# BustleBoy

Welcome to BustleBoy, a sidescrolling game in which the player attempts to dodge chairs and tables as they pick up plates! Points are added for each obstacle dodge, as well as for every plate grabbed. Health is deducted for each slip-up, and when health is at 0 the game ends! The longer you last, the harder it gets. Good luck!

Arrow keys control the player. Press "p" to pause and "space" to unpause.
